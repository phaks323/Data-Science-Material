# What is Virgilio?

Studying and reading through the Internet means swimming in an **infinite jungle of chaotic information**, even more so in rapidly changing innovative fields. 

_Have you ever felt overwhelmed_ when trying to approach **Data Science** without a real “path” to follow? 

Are you tired of clicking “Run”, “Run”, “Run”.. on a Jupyter Notebook, with that false sense of confidence given by the comfort zone of the work of others?

Have you ever got confused because of the several and contradicting names for the same algorithm or approach, from different websites and fragmented tutorials? 

**Virgilio addresses these critical issues for free, for everyone.**
